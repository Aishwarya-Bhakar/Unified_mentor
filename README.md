# World Population Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global population data from 1970 to 2022 using machine learning techniques to predict future population trends. The insights gained from this analysis are valuable for strategic planning in various sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, and resource management.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical population data to uncover trends and patterns.
- Develop a predictive model to forecast future population growth.
- Provide insights into regional variations and demographic shifts.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains population statistics for over 230 countries. It includes features such as:
- Country name
- Population size (from 1970 to 2022)
- Growth rates
- Population density

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: The dataset was imported and inspected for structure and completeness.
2. Data Preprocessing: Missing values were handled, unnecessary columns were removed, and duplicates were checked.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key trends were visualized using various plots to understand population dynamics.
4. Model Development: A Linear Regression model was created to predict future population growth, achieving an R² score of 0.951.
5. Model Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² metrics.

## Key Findings
- The global population is projected to reach 12.05 billion by 2050.
  India is expected to surpass China as the most populous country by **2030**.
- Significant growth is anticipated in many African countries, while some nations may experience declines.
